Place the remaining cards face down in the center as the 'fish pond.' \n\nGoal: The goal is to collect sets of four cards of the same rank, such as four Queens, four 7s, etc. \n\nPick a player to go first. On your turn, ask any player for a specific rank of card. For example, you might ask, 'Do you have any 4s?' You can only ask for a rank that you have at least one card of in your hand. If the player you ask has one or more cards of the rank you requested, they must give them to you. Take the cards and place them in your set of matching cards. If the player you asked does not have any cards of the rank you requested, they say, 'Go Fish!' Then, you must draw a card from the “fish pond” (deck). If the card you draw is the rank you asked for, you get another turn. If not, play passes to the next player. Whenever you collect four cards of the same rank, place them face down in front of you. This is a set, and you score a point. The game continues until all sets have been formed or until the deck is empty. \n\nWinning: The player with the most sets of four cards at the end of the game wins. If there's a tie, the player with the most points wins."
